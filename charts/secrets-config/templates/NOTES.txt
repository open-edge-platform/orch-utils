Vault seal keys have been saved as secret `vault-keys` in the `orch-platform` namespace.

These keys MUST be backed up outside of the cluster. If the keys are lost, there is no way to recover Vault.

Use this command to extract the keys:

kubectl -n orch-platform get secret vault-keys -o jsonpath='{.data.vault-keys}' | base64 -d

{{ else }}

Since Vault was manually initialized, please ensure seal keys were backed up in a secure location.

Vault's root token was revoked per production hardening guidelines. Use JWT authentication method to authenticate with Vault.
