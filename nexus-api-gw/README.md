# Nexus API Gateway

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

## Overview

Nexus API Gateway is a cloud-native application on the Edge Orchestrator. It is a multi-tenant API Gateway and one of
the core and central functions of the Centralized IAM.

The API Gateway provides the following functionality:

- It provides a unified API endpoint for all the APIs for accessing Open Edge Platform Services.
- It contains a tenancy-aware authentication layer, which authenticates each of the API request messages.
- It contains a tenancy and hierarchy-aware authorization layer for authorization of all the API request messages.
- It has an API remapping module that provides isolation between external and internal service APIs.
- It has a declarative policy management layer and APIs.
- It has an extensible common interception point for all APIs in the Open Edge Platform.

The Nexus API Gateway exposes an HTTP endpoint that serves the hierarchical Open Edge Platform APIs. The user request
terminates at the API gateway, where authentication and authorization-related processing is done before the request
is proxied to the appropriate backend service.

Nexus API Gateway is responsible for five primary functions:

- `HTTP Server` - This exposes endpoints to serve the hierarchical Open Edge Platform Service APIs.
  In addition to those, it also provides the following endpoints:
  - `/openapi` - This endpoint returns a unified OpenAPI spec for all Open Edge Platform user-facing APIs.
  - `/swagger` - This will render a Swagger page, providing a user-friendly page to interact with
    the Open Edge Platform system using APIs.
- `AuthN` - It is an authentication plugin layer. This layer authenticates the user of an API request.
  In detail, it does the following:
  - Validates the JWT token presented as part of the API request.
  - Extracts the following data from the API request:
    - Org/Tenant of the user from JWT
    - Active project associated with the request. This is inferred from the API request URL.
    - All projects that the user is associated with. This is from JWT.
    - Claims associated with the user. This is from the JWT.
  - Returns the result of authentication to the API Gateway.
- `AuthZ` - It is an authorization plugin layer. This layer authorizes the user of an API request. The authorization
  layer constitutes a centralized policy decision and enforcement point in the Open Edge Platform. This layer is
  independent of the PDP/PEP implemented in the Open Edge Platform services. It has broadly two parts:
  - `Policy specification` - This comprises the definition of roles and rules.
  - `Policy enforcement` - This layer deals with the enforcement logic of policies that should be applied to
    the API request by a user. The incoming requests can be broadly classified into three categories/types:
    - IAM/SI Admin Persona
    - Org Admin Persona
    - Open Edge Platform User Persona
- `API Remapping` - The API remapping plugin provides a URI rewrite scheme that maps external-facing URIs with
  the internal representation of those corresponding APIs with the following benefits:
  - Exposes a multi-tenant, hierarchical API to the external users, structured to comply with industry-standard
    API guidelines like Google APIâ€™s, AWS API, etc.
  - Avoids the need for backend services to migrate the served APIs to roll this out to the user.
    Rather, the remapping feature provides a path where the user gets the benefit of the newer API right away,
    without requiring the backend to be changed as a prerequisite. The APIs to be mapped are specified as configuration
    by the admin, at install/upgrade time, through API remapping K8s CRD. The expectation is that these CRs will only
    be created/updated at the time of install or upgrade. Otherwise, these mappings are not expected to be changed
    at runtime.
- `Proxy to Open Edge Platform Services` - Upon completion of processing all plugins, the request is now ready to
  be proxied to the appropriate Open Edge Platform backend service. The response from the backend will be copied back to
  the original request, back to the user.

## Get Started

Install Nexus API Gateway.

```shell
helm install -n orch-iam --create-namespace charts/nexus-api-gw
```

Another way to try out Nexus API Gateway is by using the Open Edge Platform deployment.

## Develop

Nexus API Gateway is developed in the **Go** language and is built as a Docker image through a `Dockerfile` in
the `nexus-api-gw` folder. The CI integration for this repository will publish the container image to
the Edge Orchestrator Release Service OCI registry upon merging to the `main` branch.

Nexus API Gateway has a corresponding Helm chart in the `charts/nexus-api-gw` folder.
The CI integration for this repository will publish these Helm charts to the Edge Orchestrator Release Service OCI
registry upon merging to the `main` branch. Nexus API Gateway is deployed to the Edge Orchestrator using
this Helm chart, whose lifecycle is managed by Argo CD (see [Foundational Platform]).

### Prerequisites

This code requires the following tools to be installed on your development machine:

- [Go\* programming language](https://go.dev) - check the [Makefile](./Makefile) for usage
- [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) - check the [Makefile](./Makefile) for usage
- [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) - check the [Makefile](./Makefile) for usage
- [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) - check the [Makefile](./Makefile) for usage
- [reuse](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool) - check the [Makefile](./Makefile) for usage
- Python\* programming language version 3.10 or later
- [gocover-cobertura](https://github.com/boumenot/gocover-cobertura) - check the [Makefile](./Makefile) for usage
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to build containers
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install Helm charts for end-to-end tests

### Build, Scan, and Test

The basic workflow to make changes to the code, verify those changes, and create a GitHub pull request (PR) is:

0. Edit and build the code with the `make go-build` command.

1. Run linters with the `make lint` command.

2. Run the unit tests with the `make test` command.

3. Build the code with the `make build` command.

## Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! To contribute, please open a pull request to have your changes reviewed
and merged into the `main` branch. We encourage you to add appropriate unit tests and end-to-end tests if
your contribution introduces a new feature. See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information.

Additionally, ensure the following commands are successful:

```shell
make test
make lint
make license
make build
```

You can use `help` to see a list of makefile targets.
The following is a list of makefile targets that support developer activities:

- `fmt` to run `go fmt` against Go source files
- `vet` to run `go vet` against Go source files
- `lint` to run a list of linting targets
- `license` to run a scan for the License headers in source code files
- `hadolint` to lint Dockerfile(s) using hadolint
- `go-lint` to lint Go source files with golangci-lint
- `yamllint` to lint YAML files using yamllint
- `go-tidy` to update the Go dependencies and regenerate the `go.sum` file
- `go-build` to build the Go source code files
- `test` to run the unit tests
- `coverage` to run the unit test coverage
- `build` to build the Nexus API Gateway Docker container
- `release` to publish the built Nexus API Gateway Docker container to a pre-defined Docker container registry.
  This registry is set in an environment variable (`API_GW_DOCKER_IMAGE_OEP`) in `nexus-api-gw/Makefile`.
